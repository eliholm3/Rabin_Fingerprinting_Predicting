How to run the code:
Option 1: Use uv package manager
Commands: uv run fingerPrintSampleCreation.py
          uv run fingerPrintModeling.py

Option 2: Download dependancies manually and run using "python3" instead of "uv run"

Note: This was developed using WSL but it should work with powershell also
